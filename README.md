## Notes app

This notes app project was created during week 1 of Makers Academy, as part of our TDD training. The project was test driven from scratch using Rspec.

The user can add notes using the `add` method, then either view a specific note, or view all of the stored note titles.

The program can be run using IRB: `irb`; `require "./lib/notes.rb"`. Tests can be run using `rspec`.
